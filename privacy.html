            <h1 class="tac gray">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
            <p> <span class="span">Our Promise to you</span> <br><br>
                Silver by Mail is committed to protecting your privacy; we will only use the information that we collect
                about you lawfully and use this information to make your shopping experience as easy and enjoyable as
                possible.<br><br>

                Silver by Mail is the trading name of Z Marketing Ltd, a company incorporated in England and our company
                number is 04452382. We are a data controller registered with the Information Commissioner.<br><br>

                As with all eCommerce websites, we collect your personal information when you shop with Silver by Mail.
                It is required to process your order, inform you of any problems and occasionally to send you special
                offers and promotions.

                <br> <br> <span class="span">The Information We Collect</span> <br><br>
                Your full name – so we know what to call you
                Email address – so we can email your order confirmations, delivery information, offers etc. You can
                unsubscribe here at any time. Please allow up to 12 days for you request to be updated across all our
                systems.<br><br>
                Delivery address – so we can send your order to the correct place
                Telephone number – we’ll only ever call if we need to talk to you about your order with us
                Credit card details – encrypted to the highest security standards.<br><br>

                We also retain information provided by our website visitors, such as registration information,
                transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases)
                and contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number). On request with verification, we will give
                the visitor a reminder with unique identifier information (e.g., customer password). Visitors also have
                the ability to correct inaccuracies in contact information and unique identifiers.<br><br>

                There are circumstances where we may have received personal data from trusted third parties including
                Epsilon, Sub2, Experian and Conexance to try and reach new customers. They would have received an
                individual’s name from another mail-order company and this customer indicated to them they wouldn’t mind
                receiving offers from companies such as Silver by Mail. If this applies to you, you can email us at
                contactus@silver.uk.com or write to The Data Protection Officer, Freepost RTLH-ZKYB-RYSA, Nottingham,
                NG4 1BR at any time and ask not to receive any mailings from Silver by Mail in the future.

                <br> <br> <span class="span">How We Use Your Information</span> <br><br>
                When you shop with us, you’re entering a contract and that’s one of the bases we use for processing your
                data. Under data protection law, it is considered a legitimate business interest for us to use our
                customers’ details for direct marketing. We understand that not everybody wants to receive our offers
                and promotions, so if you do not wish to receive any further email messages from us, you can either
                click unsubscribe at the bottom of any of our emails or email us at contactus@silver.uk.com with this
                request.<br><br>

                If you do not wish to receive any further posted catologue mailings from us, you can either email us at
                contactus@silver.uk.com with this request or write to The Data Protection Officer, Freepost
                RTLH-ZKYB-RYSA, Nottingham, NG4 1BR.<br><br>

                If you have opted in to receiving offers in the post from companies who we think may interest you, but
                have now changed your mind, please contact us via email telephone ot post or update your marketing
                preferences via your online account.<br><br>

                Please ensure you include your full name and address as well as account number, if applicable. As
                catalogues are printed in advance, so it may take up to 8 weeks for the process to be complete.
                <br><br>
                We may also use your Information to provide you with targeted digital advertisements or marketing
                communications we believe may be of interest to you. They may collect anonymous information about your
                visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. This anonymous information
                is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major
                websites. For more detailed information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network
                Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at
                http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.<br><br>

                You can opt out of targeted advertising by:<br><br>

                <br> <br> <span class="span">Sharing Information With Others</span> <br><br>
                Circumstances where we may share some of your data with others include the use of credit reference
                agencies, fraud prevention and detection agencies, delivery companies and data processing analysts that
                we use to process the orders you place with us or who assist us in the service we provide to you. In
                these instances, we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function.<br><br>

                Epsilon Abacus (registered as Epsilon International UK Ltd), a company that manages the Abacus Alliance
                on behalf of UK retailers. The participating retailers are active in the following product categories:
                clothing, collectables, food & wine, gardening, gadgets & entertainment, health & beauty, household
                goods, and home interiors. They share information on what their customers buy. Epsilon Abacus analyses
                this pooled information to help retailers understand consumers’ wider buying patterns. From this
                information, retailers can tailor their communications, sending people suitable offers that should be of
                interest to them, based on what they like to buy.<br><br>

                Your personal data is shared with Experian Ltd for the purposes of managing a service called Club
                Canvasse, a home shopping and direct retailer data co-operative of which Silver by Mail are members. By
                sharing information on what customers buy and pooling that with contributions from other members of the
                co-operative, the service allows Silver by Mail to better understand our customers and to communicate
                with you more effectively.<br><br>

                We work with Sub2 Technologies Limited ("Sub2"), a company which assists us with postal marketing. Sub2
                manages a co-operative which is made up of brands which engage in postal marketing. These brands share
                with Sub2 information about individuals, including you, who receive their postal marketing. This
                information is pooled and analysed by Sub2 so that Sub2 can better understand your interests and
                consumer habits. The result is that your data will be shared with other brands which Sub2 thinks you may
                want to hear from (unless you have opted-out), so that you receive postal marketing which is tailored to
                you. The types of brand that you are likely to hear from may be in the retail industry or may be in
                other industries, including but not limited to the financial services, charity, or utilities industries,
                but in each case, they data will only be shared for postal marketing purposes.<br><br>

                We also work with a Company called Conexance that processes customer transactional data on behalf of
                each Member. This process highlights spending patterns and allows us to identify suitable prospects to
                receive an introduction from us via the post. Thus, we send offers and information only to prospective
                customers that are likely to be interested in buying from us. Co-op Member brands operate in numerous
                categories, including apparel, home and garden, collectables, food and wine, gadgets and gifts,
                entertainment, health and beauty, travel and leisure. If you would like to exclude certain categories or
                rather your information was not included in this processing at all just email dpo@conexancemd.com and we
                will ensure it is not shared for the purpose above.<br><br>

                In the unlikely event that our business assets are ever sold to or purchased by another company our data
                records are part of our business.<br><br>

                We will never pass on your details to carefully selected third parties for marketing purposes unless you
                agreed to it when you first registered with Silver by Mail or later agreed to do so.<br><br>

                How long We Keep Information
                Any information relating to your account, including your customer details, order history and
                correspondence records is kept while you are still an active customer.
